## soliscloud adapter for IOBroker

This integration is based on this home-assistant integration:
https://github.com/hultenvp/solis-sensor

The steps to get the needed data to use the integration are as following:

Create a ticket with ginlong to request enabling API access on your account and wait untill they confirm the change
You can find the contact information for your region here: https://www.solisinverters.com/global/contactus.html

- Go to https://www.soliscloud.com/#/apiManage.
- Activate API management and agree with the usage conditions.
- After activation, click on view key tot get a pop-up window asking for the verification code.
- First click on "Verification code" after which you get an image with 2 puzzle pieces, which you need to overlap each other using the slider below.
- After that, you will receive an email with the verification code you need to enter (within 60 seconds).
- Once confirmed, you get the API ID, secret and API URL
- The plant ID you need to enter in the settings is the ID found in the url once you are logged in. For example: soliscloud.com/#/station/stationdetail_1?id=**123486816843454864**

This adapter will read multiple values available from the soliscloud API and store them for use in ioBroker.
To request additional values, you can either:

- Comment on the ioBroker forums here: https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/69026/new-adapter-soliscloud/37
- Email me on trixdev034@gmail.com
- create an issue on github

The API returns other values that can be added, but at the moment these are sufficient for my needs.

## Current state

This adapter is still very new, but tested and seemingly stable.
I'm not a professional developer. Use at your own risk.
